    "# Scikit Learn & Kaggle\n",
    "This week, we're going to learn about sci-kit learn.  For this lesson, I also want to introduce you to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) and its massive community of data scientists and learning materials.  Kaggle is a great place to get your feet wet with machine learning projects, and compare your approach to how others -- often hundreds of others -- have tackled the same problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we're going to walk through a Kaggle competition that is perfect for learning about scikit learn: The [Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step is to go to the site and learn a bit about the challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic\n",
    "2. Once you've got a sense of what we're trying to do (predict whether a person will survive), we'll walk through the basics of loading our packages and data.  \n",
    "3. Then we'll spend a fair amount of time just looking at the data and gettting it into good shape for sklearn. \n",
    "4. Then we'll actually use sklearn and learn the basics.  You'll see pretty quickly why people use scikit learn -- it lets you try out many combinations of paremeters in many types of models with a simple set of commands. \n",
    "5. Then, we'll connect all our steps togehter into what sklearn calls a \"pipeline\". This will add a layer of complexity to our work, but will allow us to use something called \"grid search\" to train our model across the entire grid of possilbe features combintions and features weights for any classifier. \n",
    "5. Finally, once we have our pipeline up and running, we can submit it to Kaggle & officially join the data science community there. Don't worry, there is pretty much zero chance that we will win the competition.  But we will win a place in the heart of data science! "

    "\n",
    "The difference between a good model and a great model often depends on feature generation. Even when we just have a few variables like this, we can often generate hundreds of features from them by looking at various combinations.  For example, if we were really careful, we could probably figure out which passangers belong to which family and create a family ID.  Maybe members of smaller families do better than larger families, all other things being equal. Maybe single folks are more likely to survive because they are not held back by trying to save other family members.  Maybe members of families are more likely to survive because they are more motivated and can work together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We're not going to spend time adding all these features, but if this were something like detecting malignant tumors or scheduling police -- or perhaps even more importantly, finding rats! -- we'd be generating as many features as we could plausibly come up with.  As you'll see in a bit, having too many features is not as serious a problem for sklearn as it is for traditional frequentist linear models like traditional regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "All that is to say that feature generation is very important.  Try your hand at generating some features below. Start with an easy one: family size. Or try more if you like! "
